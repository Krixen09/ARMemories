# MemoriesAR System Design

## Implementation Approach

Based on the PRD requirements, we'll implement the MemoriesAR Android application using the following approach:

### Architecture Pattern
We'll use the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern as specified in the PRD for clean separation of concerns:
- **View Layer**: Activities and Fragments for the UI
- **ViewModel Layer**: Handles UI-related logic and state
- **Model Layer**: Repositories, data sources, and business logic

### Core Technologies

1. **Android Native Development**
   - Primary Language: Kotlin (with Java compatibility)
   - Minimum SDK: Android 7.0 (API level 24)
   - Target SDK: Latest stable release
   - AndroidX libraries for UI components and functionality

2. **AR Implementation**
   - EasyAR SDK for image tracking and AR content display
   - CameraX API for camera feed processing
   - OpenGL ES for rendering optimizations

3. **QR Code and Image Recognition**
   - Google ML Kit for QR code scanning
   - EasyAR's image tracking capabilities

4. **Backend Services**
   - Firebase Authentication for user management
   - Firebase Cloud Storage for media storage
   - Firebase Firestore for metadata and user data
   - Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side processing

5. **Media Processing**
   - ExoPlayer for video playback
   - Android MediaCodec for video processing
   - Glide for image loading and caching

6. **Dependency Injection and Reactive Programming**
   - Hilt for dependency injection
   - Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations
   - LiveData for lifecycle-aware data observation

### Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

1. **Image Recognition Accuracy**
   - Challenge: Reliable recognition of physical photographs in various lighting conditions
   - Solution: Use EasyAR's advanced tracking algorithms with custom calibration for different environments. Implement image enhancement pre-processing for better recognition.

2. **AR Content Stability**
   - Challenge: Maintaining stable AR content overlay on moving targets
   - Solution: Use sensor fusion (gyroscope, accelerometer) for motion tracking and apply smoothing algorithms to content positioning.

3. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Challenge: Providing functionality without internet connection
   - Solution: Implement Room database for local caching of content metadata and previously downloaded media. Use WorkManager for background sync when connectivity is restored.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Challenge: Ensuring smooth performance across diverse Android devices
   - Solution: Implement adaptive quality settings based on device capabilities, optimize video encoding parameters, and use hardware acceleration where available.

5. **Battery Consumption**
   - Challenge: AR processing is power-intensive
   - Solution: Implement battery-saving modes, optimize tracking frame rates when device is stationary, and offer user-configurable quality settings.

   - Content access control based on creator settings
   - Protection against unauthorized content scraping

4. **Privacy Protection**
   - Clear privacy policy and consent mechanisms
   - Minimize collection of personal data
   - User control over data sharing settings

5. **API Security**
   - Secure API key storage in Android Keystore
   - Rate limiting for API requests
   - Input validation on all API endpoints
