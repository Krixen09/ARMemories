## 1. Industry Overview

### 1.1 AR Image Recognition Market

Augmented Reality (AR) applications that utilize image recognition technology have grown significantly in recent years, with the global AR market projected to reach $97.76 billion by 2028. Image-based AR applications represent a substantial segment of this market, offering intuitive ways to bridge physical and digital content.

Image recognition AR apps operate primarily in two modes:
- **Marker-based tracking**: Uses specific encoded markers (like QR codes) to determine position and overlay content
- **Markerless tracking**: Recognizes natural images without specialized markers

The latter approach, employed by Stories-AR and the planned ARMemories application, provides a more seamless user experience by working with existing photographs without modification.

### 1.2 Mobile AR Platform Distribution

The AR platform landscape shows significant fragmentation between iOS and Android devices:
- Android: 70.97% global market share
- iOS: 28.27% global market share

Despite Android's dominant market position, many AR applications prioritize iOS development due to standardized hardware specifications and ARKit's robust capabilities. This creates a significant opportunity for Android-focused AR applications that can deliver comparable experiences across the diverse Android ecosystem.

### 1.3 Key Technology Enablers

The development of effective AR image recognition applications for Android relies on several key technologies:

- **AR SDKs**: Platforms like EasyAR, ARCore, and Vuforia provide fundamental AR capabilities
