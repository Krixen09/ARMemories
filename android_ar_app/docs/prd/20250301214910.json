The app should offer a seamless AR experience, be performant, and leverage Firebase to enhance user engagement and retention.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement AR functionalities using EasyAR"],["P0","Integrate Firebase for user data management and analytics"],["P1","Design a user-friendly interface and experience"],["P1","Ensure the app is responsive and performs well on a range of devices"],["P2","Develop a tutorial for new users on how to navigate and use the app"]],"UI Design draft":"The app will feature a minimalistic design with a focus on ease of use. The main screen will display a live AR viewfinder. A bottom navigation bar will allow users to switch between different sections of the app, such as AR experiences, saved content, and settings. Interactive tutorials will guide users through the app's features.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specific AR experiences and content to be included in the app are not defined. Further clarification is needed on the target audience and their preferences."}
